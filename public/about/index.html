    <li><strong>Project description</strong>: Our project focuses on the analysis of global health data through the
        development of an API that integrates information on deaths caused by risk factors across different countries,
        as well as data on pandemics and pandemic-related mortality. We examine the geographical and temporal
        distribution of these health outcomes and explore their relationship with global patterns of disease spread and
        public health impact. The objective is to provide a unified and accessible data source that facilitates the
        understanding of how risk factors and pandemics have affected populations worldwide over time.</li>
