We examine the geographical and temporal distribution of these health outcomes and explore their relationship with global patterns of disease spread and public health impact. The objective is to provide a unified and accessible data source that facilitates the understanding of how risk factors and pandemics have affected populations worldwide over time.\r - **Repository**: [gti-sos/SOS2526-10](https://github.com/gti-sos/SOS2526-10)",
